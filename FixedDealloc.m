The corrected `dealloc` method ensures that objects are only released once and only if they are owned by the current object.  Avoid explicitly calling `release` on objects that you didn't explicitly retain.  If using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting), rely on the system's automatic management, and avoid manual memory management within `dealloc`.  Proper use of `weak` properties for non-owning references helps prevent double-release issues.

```objectivec
// FixedDealloc.m
@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    // Release objects only if they are owned by this class and not already released
    if (_myObject) {
        _myObject = nil; // ARC will handle release
    }
    [super dealloc]; //Optional in ARC, but generally recommended for consistency
}
@end
```
